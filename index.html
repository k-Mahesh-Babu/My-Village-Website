                    The city was also known as Kshirapuri, (క్షీరపురి, Telugu) which means "sea of milk" in Sanskrit.The city was carved out of Sudhanagaram, original name of Patha Chirala, that was granted to Chirala Anantharaju by Goparaju Ramanna, Minister of the Kakatiya king, Ganapati Deva, during Saka 1067 (1145 AD) as mentioned in the records obtained from the Madras Oriental Library. His descendant, Chirala Venkata Krishnudu, leased out the present Chirala area for raising a new township. Thus, present-day Chirala was born on 1604 AD.
